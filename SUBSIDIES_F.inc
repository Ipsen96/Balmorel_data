* Notice: It would be nice with a table, where "end of support" could be registed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
* Notice: The actual support for Biogas in DK includes an additional fee of 10 DKK/GJ, however, since this fee is gradually faced out until 2020 (where most of our Balmorel analyses are initiated, this is not included in the data)                                                                                                                                                
* Notice: The production support is phased out after 2020, we assume it is replaced with a support which contain the basic support (ex NG-price adaptation) and then follow the cost development for biogas production
